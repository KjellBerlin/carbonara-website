                The Carbonara App is a full-stack project designed to demonstrate how to build an end to end product with limited resources. Based on an imaginary meal delivery concept, it integrates various technologies, including a frontend, backend, database, authentication, and payment processing. While it's not a functional delivery app, it showcases the practical challenges and solutions in modern app development.
