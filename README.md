# The Carbonara App

The Carbonara app is an open-source project designed to demonstrate how various components can be combined to create a fully functional end-to-end solution, with both frontend and backend.

The imaginary use case for this app is a meal delivery service, where users can order meals and have them instantly delivered within a specific geographic area.
